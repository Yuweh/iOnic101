### What is Ionic?

Ionic framework is an open source for the mobile development. The original version of Ionic was released in 2013, built on top of Angular JS. Moreover, it provides all the features of the native mobile apps such as users can build their own apps and can customize accordingly. These apps can be deployed through Cordova. In addition, with the usage of Angular, Ionic provides custom components and methods for interacting with them. For the creation of Ionic, CSS (Cascade Style Sheet), HTML5 (Hyper Text Market language), and Sass Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets programming languages are used. These programming languages make Ionic fairly similar to use.
